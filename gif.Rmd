This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
read.csv("f1_data2.csv")


#gaptime

library(gganimate)

library(glue)

dat <- subset(f1_data2, CIRCUITREF == "monaco")


head(dat)

fig_f1 <- ggplot(data = f1_data2, aes(x = country, y = qual_time, frame = YEAR)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = finish_position)) +
  geom_smooth() + 
  transition_time(YEAR) +
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}",
       x = "Qualifying Posiion",
       y = "Qualifying Time")

anim <- animate(fig_f1, fps = 8)
anim

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
